Access to essential medicines remains a persistent challenge across urban and rural India. Patients — especially those with chronic conditions — often struggle to locate required medications due to:

📍 Limited availability at nearby pharmacies  

As a result, they’re forced to visit multiple pharmacies, leading to:

- ⏱️ Wasted time  
- 😓 Increased stress  
- 🚗 Unnecessary travel
