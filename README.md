Problem Statement:
Access to essential medicines is a persistent challenge in many regions of India. Patients, especially those with chronic conditions, frequently face difficulties in locating necessary medications due to stock shortages, lack of transparency in inventory management, and limited availability at nearby pharmacies. This issue is exacerbated in both rural and urban areas, leading to patients having to visit multiple pharmacies, wasting time and effort.

Proposed Solution:
MediConnext will be a user-friendly mobile application designed to provide real-time updates on the availability of medicines across connected pharmacies, with the added option of home delivery. By linking the app to the inventory management systems of participating pharmacies, users can quickly find medications by name, compare availability at different locations, and place orders for delivery or pick-up.

Technology Stack:
Frontend Development: Flutter (for a cross-platform mobile app) or React Native for seamless Android and iOS compatibility.
Backend Development: Node.js with Express for handling API requests, and Firebase or AWS for cloud storage and real-time database management.
Database: MySQL or MongoDB for user data, inventory management, and order tracking.
Machine Learning: TensorFlow or PyTorch for personalized medicine recommendations based on user behavior, predictive stock alerts, and demand forecasting.
Inventory Integration: APIs with pharmacy POS systems (like Marg ERP, PharmSoft, or GoFrugal) for seamless stock updates.
Delivery Logistics: Google Maps API for location tracking, real-time delivery updates, and efficient route optimization.
Impact:
This solution will streamline access to medications, reduce the time patients spend searching for medicines, and enable pharmacies to better manage stock and reach more customers. By incorporating machine learning algorithms, MediConnect can also provide smart features such as alternative medicine suggestions and stock predictions, improving overall healthcare accessibility and efficiency.
